Kymographs of a ratiometric calcium indicator in growing pollen tubesKymographs of Arabidopsis pollen tubes growing in vitro, featuring two channels (YFP and CFP) of the genetically encoded ratiometric calcium probe YC3.6.File naming consist on underscore separated metadata, namely species abbreviation (Arab), ecotype (Col-0), assay abbreviation (Kymo), date (DDMMYY – sample from A-Z) and channel (YFP or CFP). Available in the folder ‘/ratio_kymo’.Transgenic Arabidopsis pollen tubes (Col-0) expressing the ratiometric Ca2+ probe YC3.6 under the LAT52 promoter were imaged every 4 sec. on an Applied Precision DeltavisionCORE system, mounted on an Olympus inverted microscope, equipped with a Front Illuminated sCMOS, 2560x2160, Pixel size 6.45 um and an InsightSSI fluorescence illuminator, using a 60x 1.2NA water immersion objective. Filter sets: excitation 426/450 nm (CFP) and 505-515 nm (YFP); emission 458/487 nm (CFP) and 520/550 nm (YFP). Kymographs were generated using ImageJ (Multiple Kymograph plugin) averaging over a 5-pixel neighborhood along a manual trace through the PT midline for a single or both YFP and CFP channels.
