Synchronized oscillations in growth, H+ flux and intracellular Ca2+Growth rate series from a tracking software (MetaMorph) is provided (Track in the ‘/track’ folder with matching date), together with a kymograph (Kymo in the ‘/kymo’ folder) with fluorescence of a calcium reporter (Yellow Cameleon 3.6) and extracellular H+ flux measurements at the pollen tube tip from an ion-selective vibrating probe (H-VP in the ‘/vp’ folder). File naming consist on underscore separated metadata, namely species abbreviation (Arab), ecotype (Col-0), assay abbreviation (Track, Kymo or H-VP), date (DDMMYY – sample from A-Z), matching files in the data set of ratiometric kymographs.      Tracking data files are raw outputs from MetaMorph where “Time Interval”, and “Velocity” are the variables of interest in this study, performed with a region of interest / search region of 30 x 30 / 50 x 50. The ability of each method to detect oscillations was then investigated using a long and highly oscillatory time series (Video S1). In order to guarantee an impartial comparison, the kymograph used in the analysis was extracted from a modified version of the tracking trace generated on MetaMorph. The series of tip location estimates generated by the “Track Object” routine (line in Video S1) was extended to create the line used to extract pixel intensities at each time point, yielding the kymograph. This procedure controls for noise and biases caused by manually drawing paths along the pollen tube midline, the traditional way to generate kymographs.      The ion-selective vibrating probewas used to estimate extracellular proton flux at the tip of PTs. Arabidopsis pollen grains were collected from fresh flowers and then germinated in liquid medium containing: 500 uM KCl, 500 uM CaCl2, 125 uM MgSO4, 0.005% H3BO3, 125 uM HEPES, and 16% of sucrose at pH 7.5. Pollen grains were incubated at 21.5°C for at least 3h. Growing PTs longer than 150 um were assayed using previously described protocols for measuring H+-specific fluxes. Data acquisition, voltage parameters, and control of the three-dimensional electrode micromanipulator were performed with the ASET software (Science Wares and Applicable Electronics). Simultaneous widefield-imaging of Arabidopsis PTs was on done on a custom made rig using an inverted Nikon Eclipse TE300 equipped with an Andor iXon3 camera on the Koheler bottom port, and a Lumen 200Pro Fluorescence Illumination System. YFP signal (excitation 498/510 nm, emission 535/559 nm) was acquired simultaneously to flux measurements.
