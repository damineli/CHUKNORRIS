MetaMorph tracking of the pollen tube tipTracking and growth rate series of the of the same growing pollen tubes (Arabidopsis Col-0) where the ratiometric kymographs where extracted, performed with the 'Track Object' routine in MetaMorph with 3 different ROI sizes. Available in the folder ‘/track’.File naming consist on underscore separated metadata, namely species abbreviation (Arab), ecotype (Col-0), assay abbreviation (Track), date (DDMMYY – sample from A-Z), matching files in the data set of ratiometric kymographs.Files are raw outputs from MetaMorph where “Time Interval”, “Velocity” and “Object #” are the variables of interest in this study. The “Object #” correspond to regions of interest / search regions of different sizes being: object #1 – 30 x 25 / 50 x 40; object #2 – 25 x 20 / 30 x 30; and object #3 – 30 x 30 / 50 x 50.The subfolder ‘/track/only_ts/’ has the time series with time (minutes) and growth rate (um/min) extracted from the raw MetaMorph files with the script ‘FromMetaMorphToTS.R’. Files have the added prefix “TS_Object_#”, where # is the corresponding Object number.
